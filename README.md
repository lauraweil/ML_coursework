An overview of the skills acquired throughout the Machine Learning course offered by the Computer Science Department of Nova SBE

**Assignment 1: Machine Learning Pipelines and Data Preprocessing**

Objective
The primary focus of this assignment is on constructing robust machine learning pipelines, incorporating comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering steps. It provides hands-on experience in preparing data for effective model training.

Key Topics
- Data Cleaning: Techniques for handling missing values, outliers, and erroneous data.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data to improve model performance.
- Data Transformation: Normalization, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- Pipeline Construction: Building and evaluating end-to-end pipelines using classes for clear structure

**Assignment 2: Dimensionality Reduction and Time Series Analysis**

Objective
This assignment explores dimensionality reduction techniques, time series analysis, and the implementation of various recommender systems. It aims to provide an understanding of handling high-dimensional data and time-dependent data, along with building recommendation engines.

Key Topics
- Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and t-SNE.
- Time Series Analysis: Understanding and forecasting time-dependent data, using ANOVA forecasting
- Recommender Systems: Building three types of recommender systems:
a. Content-based Recommenders
b. Collaborative Filtering Recommenders
c. Hybrid Systems
